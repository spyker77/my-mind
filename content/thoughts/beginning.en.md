summary: "What this place is about and what it's not"

I want to show how I think. How I make decisions. How I see the world. What topics interest me. How I try, and how I fail.

You won't find tutorials here—for example, how to write code to solve a specific problem. There is more than enough of that on the internet already. And to write something truly new and useful requires a huge amount of time, which I don’t have—and I’m sure many others don’t either. In today's world, with its speed of change and given my professional focus, even just staying current is incredibly difficult, never mind actually trying things with your own hands and learning something new.

For this same reason—the lack of time—I will adhere to an iterative approach, which means the thoughts here will change from time to time. Without any schedule, just when I have the opportunity and something to share. I will add, delete, and rework things so that they reflect my current state of mind. I will raise new topics. And I will try not to use rigid filters. I don't want to seem like a "professional." This is my thought process, as raw as it is in real life.

And honestly, watching how society is developing, I even doubt that my thoughts will be read directly by people. More likely, they will ask an AI to analyze them and create a summary. I don’t fully understand how I feel about that yet, but this is roughly my vision.

That is to say, I plan to answer not the question of "what," but rather "how" and "why.
